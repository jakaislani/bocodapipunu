This talented individual is currently an entrepreneur.</p><h2>Age and Parents</h2><p>Mason was born on 11th April 1965 in the USA. The name of his parents is <strong>William Reese</strong> and <strong>Sonia Darrin</strong>. Surprisingly there is no information about the siblings. It feels like Mason is the only child in the family.</p><p>Reese is 55 years old as of now. He holds the American nationality along with the white ethnicity. His zodiac sign falls under Aries, suggesting that he is compassionate and motivated at the same time.</p><h2>Body Measurements: Height and Weight</h2><p>Mason might be aging pretty quick, but by the looks of it, the innocence is still prevalent in the former actor. His height, however, is not so tall. The former actor stands at a height of 5 ft while the weight is 70 kgs.</p><p>With the increasing age, Mason has given lesser care to his outlook and hardly hits the gym. So the case of overweight can be seen clearly at times. Sadly there is no information about the vital body statistics.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harry Shum Jr Age, Height, Wife, Child, Glee, Movies, Net Worth >></a></h4><p>Reese is pretty silent about his personal life at times, due to which the shoe and dress size of the actor is also not known to the fans. Lastly, his dark brown hair and eyes of the same color complete his physical outlook.</p><h2>Early Days and Education</h2><p>Mason was born in the states and spent his childhood there with the family and siblings. The early days were pretty decent, with most of the needs being fulfilled with ease.</p><p>Due to lack of any information on the siblings, we feel he was the only child and highly pampered all the childhood. The mother of Reese was an actress, so Mason had to look no far for any motivation in his life.</p><p>In the case of educational background, though Reese attended Saint Michael’s Montessori School. Mason was a pretty decent student but shifted school most of the time.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Mason has retired from acting for an extended period. His achievements in the showbiz world were as a child actor. Due to the mother being in the showbiz world, Reese used to appear in lots of shows as a kid.</p><p>Some of the appearances in the TV shows include Saturday Night Live Wit Howard Cosell, The Mike Douglas Show, The Howard Stern Show, This Morning,&nbsp; Mason, and many more.</p><p>In the recent appearance, Reese was seen in Life Interrupted and Sunday in the Park with doG makes a list. It has been a long gap since Mason has been actively part of the TV world.</p><p>What shot him to initial fame surely was the work in commercials. When Reese was a child, he appeared in commercials for Underwood Deviled Ham, Post Raisin Bran, Dunkin Donuts, and many more.</p><p>There were many assumptions about Mason making it big in the long run, but things didn’t pan out pretty well.</p><h2>Post Acting Career</h2><p>After leaving the acting scene he didn’t stop his career right away, but Mason found another field of career. It was as a restauranteur and entrepreneur.</p><p>Reese owned a restaurant in Manhattan, and it worked well for him. Mason was never short of trying out various careers in the restaurant.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew Postlethwaite Age, Father, Brother, Peaky Blinders, Net Worth, IG >></a></h4><p>He went on to add Destination Bar and Grille along with a sports bar named The Luxury Box. Sadly both of them closed with time, but his experiments tend to amaze the fans.</p><p>In the quest for versatility, Reese opened his own production house called Borgasmord Productions and went on to star Mason Reese Management.</p><p>His management institute tends to groom the young talent who owns the skillset to make it big in the acting world. Although Mason has been far from real-time acting, the man contributes to the field in any way possible.</p><h2>Who Is Mason Reese Girlfriend?</h2><p>Mason Reese might be far from the camera work, but his charm and fan following are still present. Fans want to know who the man is dating at this point. Well, the lucky lady is no other than<strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> Sarah Russi</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mason-674.jpg><p>Sarah is a softcore adult actress who met Reese in 2018. Their meeting was pretty casual, but the pair found their mojo pretty quickly. They have been dating since 2018 and going stronger.</p><p>In 2019, Mason was part of the TV show The Morning alongside Sarah, and this pair came out all guns blazing in front of the media. Although they have been together for two years, nothing accurate is available about engagement or marriage.</p><p>Although there is information about the current relationship for Mason, nothing accurate is available about the history of love interest. If anything good pops out, readers will be made aware.</p><h2>Net Worth: Income and Salary</h2><p>Mason was one of the well-known child actors due to his parents’ fame and skill set. But things didn’t pan out well in time for the man. Due to this, his net worth was raised from other entrepreneurship works. As of 2020, Mason owns the worth of <strong>$1 million</strong>.</p><p>All of this is the result of his acting, management institute, and also the restaurant business. In his free time, though, Reese is seen having a great time with his girlfriend.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Max Gail Bio- Net Worth, Age, Family, Career, Actor, Movies, Death >></a></h4><p>What most of the fans might not know is the fact that Mason is a big-time foodie too.
