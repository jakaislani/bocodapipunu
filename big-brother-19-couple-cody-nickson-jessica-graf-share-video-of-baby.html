They became involved in a showmance during the show and the relationship evolved once they left the house.</p><p>Jessica was sent home before the BB19 jury started getting formed, but Cody made it to the jury house, forcing the couple to be apart for a majority of the season. They reunited during the season finale.</p><p>Since their time on the show, Cody and Jessica went on to win The Amazing Race (and the $1 million prize), they got married, and Jessica gave birth to a baby girl named Maverick Nickson.</p><p>Cody also has a daughter named Paisley from a previous relationship. She was seven years old when Maverick was born. It was huge news that the Big Brother couple had a baby and they have been very forthcoming with social media posts about their growing family.</p><p>The Instagram post and video below were shared by Cody and it shows their baby girl speaking. Take a look, because it is one of the cuter things you are going to see online today.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B350kQKnRSp/</p><h2>Would Cody and Jessica return for Big Brother: All-Stars?</h2><p>There has been some debate about how interesting a season of duos would work on a show like Big Brother. It could certainly be a lot of fun if showmances or friendships from the reality competition show returned to compete for the $500,000 prize in a season of All-Stars.</p><p>If <a href=#>Kathryn Dunn and Nick Maccarone</a> are still an item that could be fun. Same with Tyler Crispen and Angela Rummans from Big Brother 20, <a href=#>who are still happily living together</a>. Add Cody Nickson and Jessica Graf to that equation and it would certainly ramp up the entertainment level of a duos season.</p><p>Would Cody and Jessica return to the show after just having a baby? Maybe not. But it’s always fun to debate about who would be good as a returning houseguest in the future.</p><p>Big Brother returns with new episodes on CBS during summer 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiamZx6o77OrZ%2Beql1mhm6vzq6npZ1dmLylxYynoJyjo6S7brbErKqim5FitLOtxWaqoZmimnq3tcOepmanlmKvoq7YaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./coco-lee-religion-ethnicity-origin-and-nationality.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Coco Lee | Religion, Ethnicity, Origin And Nationality</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./whoopi-goldberg.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Whoopi Goldberg - Movies, Age &amp;amp; Oscar</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brock-burke-net-worth-294039.html>Brock Burke Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwayne-johnson-left-to-ride-around-in-a-golf-cart-as-the-dcus-hierarchy-of-power-changes-for-real-this-time.html>Dwayne Johnson left to ride around in a golf cart as the DCUs hierarchy of power changes for real</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jean-seberg.html>Jean Seberg</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lauren-goodgers-ex-boyfriend-jake-mclean-passed-away-in-a-tragic-car-accident.html>Lauren Goodgers Ex Boyfriend Jake Mclean Passed Away In A Tragic Car Accident</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./acrimony-2-release-date.html>When Will Acrimony 2 Hit Netflix?
