That's great, but where are some of the most universally recognizable taxi driver types? For example, the three main varieties of recently arrived foreign students: (a) those who speak no English; (b) those who want to practice their English, and (c) those who know a way to get to the airport using only alleys.</p><p>The underlying inspiration for "D. C. Cab" doesn't seem to have been real taxi driver experiences, and no wonder. Although the movie was shot in Washington, a city where taxis are important (how else would you get to the tidal basin at midnight?), the movie "package" was assembled in Los Angeles, a city where everybody owns a car, taxis have to be booked in advance, and a ride to the airport costs more than a day's car rental. Furthermore, the movie's producers are <a href=#>Peter Guber</a>, formerly chief honcho of Casablanca Records, and <a href=#>Jon Peters</a>, who is, I read in 'People,' Barbra Streisand's "ex." How many hours a year do you think they spend in cabs?</p><p>"D. C. Cab" feels like a movie with a split personality. The plot is fresh off the assembly line, with a lot of nonsense about two kidnapped rich kids and how the taxi drivers team up to rescue them. A lot of time is also wasted on the story of the D. C. Cab Company's battle with a rival company, its attempt to improve its image, and a fight over who will share a reward for a lost violin. These are all, as you can well imagine, paralyzingly boring plot ideas.</p><p>There is vitality in the movie, however, and it comes directly from the cast. There are a lot of engaging actors on screen, with lots of energy, and when they're set free to act goofy and clown around, it can be funny. The movie's star is <a href=#>Adam Baldwin</a>, a Chicago actor seen in "<a href=#>My Bodyguard</a>," and he's likable. But he and everybody else in the cast are upstaged by Mr. T, who is billed as a supporting player but has become such a personality that he, dominates every scene he's in. (If Nancy Reagan will sit on his lap while he wears a sleeveless Santa suit, you know he's hot.) The drivers create a moving mob scene; they race through the dumb plot with anarchic energy, and when it's all over, what have you got? Mindless, likable confusion. It's not the worst thing you can get from a movie.</p><p>Consumer note: <a href=#>Irene Cara</a> is billed for appearing as "herself." That's right. She gets into a cab, smiles, gives an autograph, and that's it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46dZJxlk5avbn2YcWo%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-yailin-la-mas-viral-arrested-arrest-charge.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is Yailin La Mas Viral Arrested?
