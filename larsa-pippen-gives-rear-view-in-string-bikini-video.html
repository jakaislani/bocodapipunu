Sizzling in a classy, satin bikini as she soaked up rays, the reality star drove her 5.4 million Instagram followers crazy with her curves, also walking away from her post richer. At the time, Larsa was signed to clothing brand Oh Polly, although she has since moved on to her current gig with affordable apparel giant Fashion Nova. Telling fans that her bikini was “everything” as she gushed over her swimwear, Larsa wound up with all the fan love in the world, something that isn’t always a guarantee with this star’s fans.</p><h2>Killer Curves In Bikini Sunbathe</h2><p>Scroll for the photo. Striking a glam waterside pose as she eased herself into cream cushioned seating white likely on a yacht, Larsa wowed as she rocked a tiny bikini in Fuschia satin fabrics.</p><p>Flashing her cleavage and showing off her shapely legs, the 49-year-old sizzled in the sun as she leaned backward a little, with the pose doing wonders for her gym-honed abs. While the bathing suit, which came with a hgih-waisted, G-String finish, was affordable, Larsa made sure to up her designer game via her accessories.</p><h2>See More Photos Below!</h2><p>Adding in statement shades from Versace, Larsa gave a nod to her high-end lifestyle as she stunned the camera and used one hand to toy with her hair a little. “Love this fuschia bikini, it’s everything,” she wrote, then tagging Oh Polly.</p><p>“Wow baby,” one fan replied. “Unbelievably fine ❤️‍🔥,” another said, with a third telling Larsa that she looks “good in it.” As to how much Pippen may have earned, some experts at&nbsp;Vox have offered up some figures.</p><h2>What’s Her Paycheck?</h2><p id=F5ec0S>“It depends on the influencer, and their follower numbers. A micro-influencer, which is someone that has 10,000 to 50,000 followers, is actually pretty valuable. They used to only pick up a couple hundred bucks, but today, they get a minimum of a few thousands dollars a post,” the outlet states, adding:</p><p id=hjxdR0>“Influencers with up to 1 million followers can get $10,000 [per post], depending on the platform, and 1 million followers and up, you’re getting into territory where they can charge $100,000. Some can even get $250,000 for a post.” With over 5 million fans, that’s a decent amount for the ex to Scottie Pippen.</p><p>Larsa was even reported to have signed a six-figure deal with Pretty Little Thing prior to her current Fashion Nova partner status.</p><h2>Secret To Her Body</h2><p>Larsa is nearly 50 and looking hotter than ever. The workout queen swims every day, and she also pays attention to what she eats.”If you’re prepared like that you tend to eat healthier, as opposed to not knowing what you’re gonna eat and then you end up eating junk,” she told&nbsp;Hollywood Life of prepping meals for herself and her four kids.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnnJa%2FtK2MqaCpqJWjeqi11Z6qZqqVlr9uwsiermahnmLAtb7Ip55mmpmgtq%2B1jK%2BgnZ2fZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./men-of-honor-2000.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Men Of Honor movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2000)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chris-rodstrom.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Chris Rodstrom</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brock-burke-net-worth-294039.html>Brock Burke Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwayne-johnson-left-to-ride-around-in-a-golf-cart-as-the-dcus-hierarchy-of-power-changes-for-real-this-time.html>Dwayne Johnson left to ride around in a golf cart as the DCUs hierarchy of power changes for real</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jean-seberg.html>Jean Seberg</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lauren-goodgers-ex-boyfriend-jake-mclean-passed-away-in-a-tragic-car-accident.html>Lauren Goodgers Ex Boyfriend Jake Mclean Passed Away In A Tragic Car Accident</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./acrimony-2-release-date.html>When Will Acrimony 2 Hit Netflix?
