O'Neal</strong>&nbsp;is a model and actor known as the eldest kid of&nbsp;<strong>Shaquille O'Neal</strong>, the former professional basketball player. Myles has recently become the ideal description of a Tall, Dark, and Handsome guy with impressive vital numbers and a beautiful appearance.</p><p>O'Neal initially featured on the reality television show&nbsp;<i>Basketball Wives in 2010</i>. It centered on his mother's relationships with her friends. He initially appeared on the program to celebrate his 13th birthday. Shaunie's Home Court, a reality program starring O'Neal and his family, debuted in 2016.</p><h2>Who is Myles B. O'Neal's Girlfriend?</h2><p>Twenty-two-year-old Myles B. O'Neal prefers to retain his private life away from the general public's gaze. His relationship state is a mystery to all. He didn't mention his girlfriend's information at all.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/9/26/117141621_1418337255221453_2129276670880450367_n-min%20(1)-1632641826810.jpg><p>To this day, he has not distributed any of her personal information on any social media platforms.

It seems he prefers to retain his personal life as quiet as possible.</p><h2>Myles B. O'Neal's Net worth in 2021</h2><p>Myles B's fortune is undeniably opulent. With so many runaway walks and brand sponsorships, he has amassed a sizable fortune. His now net worth is estimated to be&nbsp;<strong>$300 Thousand.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/9/26/106553000_898960773847742_3251972066747952887_n-min%20(1)-1632641863885.jpg><p>However, no precise number for his net worth has been disclosed. Although his father&nbsp;<strong>Shaq</strong><a href=#>&nbsp;is worth around $400 million,</a>&nbsp;his mother Shaunie has about&nbsp;<strong>$45 million</strong>. Shaquille is a professional athlete, while Shaunie is a television personality, entrepreneur, producer, and philanthropist.&nbsp;</p><h2>Myles B. O'Neal: Wiki-bio</h2><p>Myles B. O'Neal was born onthe 8th of May 1997. His dad is alienated from him. He subsequently adopted the surname of his then stepfather, Hall of Fame basketball star Shaquille O'Neal. He was raised alongside four younger half-siblings,&nbsp;<strong>Shareef,&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>Tahirah</a>,<a href=#>Amirah</a><strong>,&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>Shaqir</a><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Me'arah</a><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;resulting from Shaunie's marriage to Shaquille.</p><p>Shaquille O'Neal and&nbsp;<a href=#>Shaunie O'Neal</a>&nbsp;are his parents. Shaq, on the other hand, is not his biological dad. Myles was the result of his mother's prior relationship before she married Shaq. Myles shared his family with five additional siblings, all of whom are his half-siblings, in addition to his parents.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/9/26/89361367_122163352695117_6113647955442637195_n-min%20(1)-1632641925058.jpg><p>Shaquille O'Neal, his dad, is a basketball player in the Fame National Basketball Association. Even though Shaq is still his legal father, his parents divorced in 2011. However, according to Shaunie, they are still close friends who adore each other.&nbsp;</p><p>The 6'3" tall, tall aspirant fashionista was raised in Atlanta and graduated from Crossroads High School. He may not be in acting or filmography, but O'Neal's eldest son studied acting for four years. He graduated from Santa Monica College with a degree in drama.</p><p><strong>Keep visiting </strong><a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>MarriedCeleb</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqawpZ2jYq9uu82emKU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./olivia-finestead-white-sox-pitcher-mike-clevinger-accused-of-domestic-violence-child-abuse.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Olivia Finestead?
