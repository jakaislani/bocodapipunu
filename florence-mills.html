The following year, she appeared on Broadway in Plantation Revue, and later the song “I'm a Little Blackbird Looking for a Bluebird” from Blackbirds became her trademark.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Career and Background</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Florence Mills was born Florence Winfrey on January 25, 1896 (some accounts say 1895), in the Washington, D.C., area. She became an entertainer as a young child, billed as "Baby Florence" and captivating audiences with song and dance. She worked in vaudeville and joined a touring company at eight years old before authorities found out she was underage. Her family eventually moved to Harlem, New York, and in 1910 Mills would form another vaudeville act—the Mills Sisters—with her siblings Olivia and Maude. Mills would later meet and wed Ulysses S. Thompson, from the troupe the Tennessee Ten, in 1923.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Big Success With 'Shuffle Along'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1921, Mills was hired to replace Gertrude Saunders in the Eubie Blake and Noble Sissle production Shuffle Along, which was a trailblazing musical with an all African-American creative team. The Off-Broadway show was a hit, and Mills became renowned for her performances, highlighted by the tune "I’m Craving for That Kind of Love."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Mills earned a reputation for her wondrous high-pitched voice, unique dance movements and comedic timing that allowed her to become an unparalleled force during the Harlem Renaissance. With Mills quite aware of the racial dynamics of the day and wishing to make a difference, she also served as an icon for African American performers and audiences of all backgrounds.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">International Show 'Blackbirds'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Though Shuffle Along was a big hit, Mills made her actual Broadway debut in 1922 in the show Plantation Revue with the role of Gypsy Blues. The musical was eventually renamed From Dixie to Broadway and played in England before being launched again on the New York stage in October 1924. Then, in 1926, Mills starred in the musical Blackbirds, which showcased the song she was most associated with—"I’m a Little Blackbird Looking for a Bluebird." The show toured internationally as well, and Mills became a massive, sought-after star in Britain.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Death and Legacy</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1927, Mills became gravely ill while abroad and returned to the States. A young woman in her 30s, she died in New York City on November 1 from appendicitis. She was revered and loved by her audience, and tens of thousands came to pay their respects on the streets outside of her Mount Zion A.M.E. Church funeral.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Literary works on the artist’s life include the books Florence Mills: Harlem Jazz Queen, by Bill Egan, and the children’s publication Harlem’s Little Blackbird, written by Renee Watson and illustrated by Christian Robinson. Archives of Mills' personal and professional papers are also held at the New York Public Library’s Schomburg Center.</p><ul data-node-id=21 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Florence Mills</li><li>Birth Year: 1896</li><li>Birth date: January 25, 1896</li><li>Birth State: D.C.</li><li>Birth City: Washington</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Female</li><li>Best Known For: Florence Mills captivated audiences during the Jazz Age and Harlem Renaissance, performing in shows such as 'Shuffle Along,' 'Plantation Revue' and 'Blackbirds.'</li><li>Industries</li><li>Astrological Sign: Aquarius</li><li>Death Year: 1927</li><li>Death date: November 1, 1927</li><li>Death State: New York</li><li>Death City: New York</li><li>Death Country: United States</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/page/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=25><ul data-node-id=27 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Florence Mills Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/musician/florence-mills</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: May 13, 2020</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGikrquZmLaiutJonaWnopq7pLGMpqClpKM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alonso-solis-calderon-net-worth-271317.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alonso Solis Calderon Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./august-rush-2007.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>August Rush movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2007)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brock-burke-net-worth-294039.html>Brock Burke Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwayne-johnson-left-to-ride-around-in-a-golf-cart-as-the-dcus-hierarchy-of-power-changes-for-real-this-time.html>Dwayne Johnson left to ride around in a golf cart as the DCUs hierarchy of power changes for real</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jean-seberg.html>Jean Seberg</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lauren-goodgers-ex-boyfriend-jake-mclean-passed-away-in-a-tragic-car-accident.html>Lauren Goodgers Ex Boyfriend Jake Mclean Passed Away In A Tragic Car Accident</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./acrimony-2-release-date.html>When Will Acrimony 2 Hit Netflix?
