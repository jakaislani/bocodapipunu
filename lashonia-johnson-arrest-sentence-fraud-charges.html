This pharmacy was a crucial node in the fraudulent scheme.</p><p>Moreover, her involvement went beyond simple ownership since she proactively encouraged wounded federal employees and claimants to join the wounded Federal Workers Advocate Association (IFWAA).</p><p>The production of compounded medications was at the center of the fraudulent scam. Additionally, Ladhonia was a crucial contributor to the creation of these drugs, along with her fellow conspirators.</p><p>The medications were developed based on federal reimbursement rates for specific ingredient formularies rather than the claimants’ medical needs.</p><p><strong>You may also like: </strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Meet Fiona MacDonald’s Husband Ewan MacDonald, Kids And Family</a></p><h2>Lashonia Johnson Arrest: What Are The Sentences Given To Her?</h2><p>Following her fraud in the medication services at Tricare, Lashonia Johnson’s arrest news started to spread all over the Internet.</p><p>Johnson’s legal issues started when she was connected to a sophisticated healthcare fraud operation that scammed TRICARE and the Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs of the Department of Labor.</p><p>She co-owned Assurance Consolidated Pharmacy and served as a director for the Injured Federal Workers Advocate Association with her husband and fellow defendant, John Cruise.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lashonia-jpg.webp><p>In the program, injured federal employees and claimants were persuaded to register with IFWAA in exchange for promises of free assistance with their workers’ compensation claims.</p><p>Likewise, the accusations made against Johnson and her accomplices were severe.</p><p>They were accused of filing fake and fraudulent claims or prescriptions for compounded and other medications, all while putting financial advantage ahead of patients’ legitimate medical needs.</p><p>Without regard to medical need, the scam comprised altering reimbursement rates and paying kickbacks to patient recruiters and doctors to prescribe these medications.</p><p>The drugs were subsequently mailed to individuals who had never requested, desired or required them. Therefore, Lashonia suffered consequences due to her actions after a lengthy court process.</p><p>Her participation in the <a href=# rel=noopener>healthcare fraud</a> plan was considered criminal and called for a harsh punishment.
