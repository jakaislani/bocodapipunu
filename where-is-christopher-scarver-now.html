He crossed the line with some people — prisoners, prison staff.</p><p>"Some people who are in prison are repentant — but he was not one of them.</p><p>"I saw heated interactions between [Dahmer] and other prisoners from time to time."</p><p>On the morning of November 28, 1994, the pair were assigned to a work detail alongside another inmate, Jesse Anderson.</p><p>The trio were tasked with cleaning the prison's gymnasium toilets when correctional officers left them alone.</p><p>Scarver, then aged 25, believed the two men were taunting him and turned around to see them "laughing under their breath".</p><p>He and Dahmer then headed into a different room, where he confronted the evil murderer about his vile <a href=#>crimes</a>.</p><p>The dad had armed himself with a metal bar from the weight room, and told Dahmer he was "fiercely disgusted" by his&nbsp;<a href=#>17 murders</a>.</p><p>He recalled: "I asked him if he did those things ’cause I was fiercely disgusted. He was shocked. Yes, he was."</p><p>He described how the depraved cannibal frantically began looking for the door, but he blocked his exit - and delivered two fatal blows to his head with a 20-inch, 5-pound metal bar.</p><p>"He ended up dead.
