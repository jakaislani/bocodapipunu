That same year, Goldberg's success with The Color Purple launched a highly visible acting career.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Goldberg won an Academy Award in 1991 for her performance in Ghost, and in 2007 she embarked on a lengthy run as moderator of the TV talk show The View. Goldberg is also known for being among a very small group of celebrities who've achieved "EGOT" status, winning an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony Award.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Goldberg was born Caryn Elaine Johnson on November 13, 1955, in New York City. Goldberg and her older brother, Clyde, were raised by their mother, Emma, in a housing project in the Chelsea section of Manhattan.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Goldberg's father abandoned the family, and her single mother worked at a variety of jobs — including teaching and nursing — to make ends meet. Goldberg changed her name when she decided that her given name was too boring. She claims to be half Jewish and half Catholic, and "Goldberg" is attributed to her family history.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With her trademark dreadlocks, wide impish grin and piercing humor, Goldberg is best known for her adept portrayals in both comedic and dramatic roles, as well as her groundbreaking work in the Hollywood film industry as an African-American woman.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Goldberg unknowingly suffered from dyslexia, which affected her studies and ultimately induced her to drop out of high school at the age of 17.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'The Spook Show'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1974, Goldberg moved to California, living in a variety of cities for the next seven years including Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco. At one point during this time, she worked as a mortuary beautician while pursuing a career in show business.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">During her stay in San Francisco, Goldberg won a Bay Area Theatre Award for her portrayal of comedienne <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/moms-mabley data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Moms Mabley" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Moms Mabley</a> in a one-woman show.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Shortly after receiving this honor, she returned to New York City. In 1983, she starred in the enormously popular The Spook Show. The one-woman Off-Broadway production featured her own original comedy material that addressed the issue of race in America with unique profundity, style and wit.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Among her most poignant and typically contradictory creations were "Little Girl," an African-American child obsessed with having blond hair; and "Fontaine," a junkie who also happens to hold a doctorate in literature.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By 1984, director Mike Nichols had moved The Spook Show to a Broadway stage, and in 1985, Goldberg won a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album for the recording of skits taken from the show.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'The Color Purple'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As a result of this success, she began to receive significant attention from Hollywood insiders.
