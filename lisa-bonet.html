In the latter part of the show's run, she crossed over and starred in the spinoff A Different World.

Her father, Allen, is African-American and her mother, Arlene, is Jewish; both have creative backgrounds in music. Bonet's parents split when she was a baby, and her mother raised her as a single parent in the Los Angeles area.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Bonet recalls her experience being a biracial child. “The world wasn’t ready for what I represented, the merging of these two races,” Bonet said in an interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.net-a-porter.com/gb/en/porter/article-33a55e73f6c7ac7b/cover-stories/cover-stories/lisa-bonet?cm_mmc=Twitter-_-Magazine-_-20180309&utm_source=t.co&utm_medium=referral&siteID=TnL5HPStwNw-WQpbSxQdfRTdA2zdsFC1Rw&Skimlinks.com=Skimlinks.com&siteID=TnL5HPStwNw-llibImHaiYl.0XwyqhUOXg&Skimlinks.com=Skimlinks.com" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Porter Edit" data-vars-ga-product-id=b5efe15b-c269-4008-b9e2-92e60b91cea0 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href="https://www.net-a-porter.com/gb/en/porter/article-33a55e73f6c7ac7b/cover-stories/cover-stories/lisa-bonet?cm_mmc=Twitter-_-Magazine-_-20180309&utm_source=t.co&utm_medium=referral&siteID=TnL5HPStwNw-WQpbSxQdfRTdA2zdsFC1Rw&Skimlinks.com=Skimlinks.com&siteID=TnL5HPStwNw-llibImHaiYl.0XwyqhUOXg&Skimlinks.com=Skimlinks.com" data-product-url="https://www.net-a-porter.com/gb/en/porter/article-33a55e73f6c7ac7b/cover-stories/cover-stories/lisa-bonet?cm_mmc=Twitter-_-Magazine-_-20180309&utm_source=t.co&utm_medium=referral&siteID=TnL5HPStwNw-WQpbSxQdfRTdA2zdsFC1Rw&Skimlinks.com=Skimlinks.com&siteID=TnL5HPStwNw-llibImHaiYl.0XwyqhUOXg&Skimlinks.com=Skimlinks.com" data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1712615&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.net-a-porter.com%2Fgb%2Fen%2Fporter%2Farticle-33a55e73f6c7ac7b%2Fcover-stories%2Fcover-stories%2Flisa-bonet%3Fcm_mmc%3DTwitter-_-Magazine-_-20180309%26utm_source%3Dt.co%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26siteID%3DTnL5HPStwNw-WQpbSxQdfRTdA2zdsFC1Rw%26Skimlinks.com%3DSkimlinks.com%26siteID%3DTnL5HPStwNw-llibImHaiYl.0XwyqhUOXg%26Skimlinks.com%3DSkimlinks.com" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=e0af02e8-5f2e-4547-a0af-5a3b1b5e38ac class="body-link product-links css-9lyfaf e1rq56bv0">Porter Edit</a> in 2018. “I didn’t always feel welcome – in my mom’s family, in my school. So I sheltered myself by always withholding a bit, because I didn’t always feel safe.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But Bonet was able to find a sense of safety in the performing arts, and after finishing high school in Van Nuys, California, she decided to major in acting at the Celluloid Actor's Studio.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Television and Film Roles</h2><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The Cosby Show</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Bonet's breakout role was playing daughter Denise Huxtable on The Cosby Show, which she starred in from 1984 to 1992. She took a short break from the show in 1987 to work on the first season of A Different World, which depicted her character, Denise, going off to college.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But Bonet was craving more complicated roles than her squeaky clean characters had to offer on network television, and 1987 became a big year of change for Bonet both professionally and personally.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Angel Heart</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Outside of her work on A Different World, Bonet set her sights on the big screen, taking on the sexually racy part of Epiphany Proudfoot in the horror flick Angel Heart, opposite Mickey Rourke. In helping promote the film, Bonet went topless for Interview magazine and responded to the notion of maintaining her wholesome image that she built on The Cosby Show. "My obligation wasn't to Denise. I felt obligated to myself and my career," she said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Around this time, Bonet was rumored to be butting heads with television patriarch <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/bill-cosby data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bill Cosby" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Bill Cosby</a> by purportedly criticizing the direction of the show and coming in late to work — hence, why she was "encouraged" to work on A Different World.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But if anyone found the young Bonet to be difficult, she had more surprises in store. Barely out of her teens, she got engaged to Lenny Kravitz at 20 and was pregnant with their daughter Zoe. Bonet's pregnancy prevented her from further working on A Different World, and in 1991, she was fired from The Cosby Show.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Among her other bigger projects, Bonet starred in Enemy of the State (1998), High Fidelity (2000), Biker Boyz (2003), Whitepaddy (2006) and the television show Life on Mars (2008). More recently, she's guest starred on her husband Jason Momoa's Sundance television series The Red Road in 2014 and Showtime's Ray Donovan in 2016.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Lenny Kravitz and Daughter Zoë</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In November 1987 Bonet married rockstar Lenny Kravitz and a month later gave birth to their daughter Zoë. Although the couple only lasted six years together, Bonet looks back and describes her experience with Kravitz as “a very accelerated time, spiritually and intellectually.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Today, she and Kravitz are good friends, with the latter sharing holidays with her, their daughter Zoë and Bonet's new family with Jason Momoa.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Jason Momoa and Children</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2004 Bonet met actor Jason Momoa at a Los Angeles jazz club. The two fell in love and eventually had two children together, daughter Lola Iolani (b. 2007) and later son Nakoa-Wolf (b. 2008). Bonet and Momoa officially married in October 2017 and live in canyon country outside of Los Angeles.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">About their enduring relationship, Bonet has nothing but praise for Momoa, who is 13 years younger than her. "What’s cool about Jason is that he’s an alpha male who stands for love and family. And to circle back to my own wounds, having an absent father, then to be fully met by a man of that stature, is really incredible," she <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.net-a-porter.com/us/en/porter/article-33a55e73f6c7ac7b/.../lisa-bonet data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=said data-vars-ga-product-id=f9e61066-7979-4695-bb65-698e42994336 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.net-a-porter.com/us/en/porter/article-33a55e73f6c7ac7b/.../lisa-bonet data-product-url=https://www.net-a-porter.com/us/en/porter/article-33a55e73f6c7ac7b/.../lisa-bonet data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1712615&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.net-a-porter.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fporter%2Farticle-33a55e73f6c7ac7b%2F...%2Flisa-bonet" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=167aada3-3f8e-49d7-be6a-4420aeb60348 class="body-link product-links css-9lyfaf e1rq56bv0">said</a>.
