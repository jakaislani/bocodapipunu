A photo of Keefe D and Orlando ‘Baby Lane’ Anderson, who was at first thought to be a suspect in the shooting incident, has gone popular on social media following his arrest. In this article, we will explore into the personal life of Keefe D, his involvement in the murder of Tupac and his net worth.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2><strong>Who Is Keefe D?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Duane Keith Davis, better known by his gang name<a href=#><strong> Keefe D</strong></a>, was born on June 14, 1963, in Compton, California, and is an African American. He is 85 kilogrammes and 1.85 metres tall. He has ties to the illustrious South Side Compton Crips gang. Keefe D has been accused of taking part in the slaying of Tupac Shakur. This 60-year-old ex-gang member showed a deep affinity for football during his formative years, playing the game regularly with Suge Knight when they were teenagers. He then chose to affiliate himself with the South Side Compton Crips gang later on.</p><h2><strong>Tupac Shakur Death Linked To Keefe D</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ghbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/keefe-d.webp?ezimgfmt=ng%3Awebp%2Fngcb1%2Frs%3Adevice%2Frscb1-1"><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>At the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas on the evening of September 7, 1996, Tupac and his friends got into a fight with Anderson, Keefe D’s nephew. Just three hours before Tupac Shakur’s tragic death, this encounter took place. During the investigation, Anderson and his uncle were both viewed as possible suspects.</p><p>Sean “Diddy” Combs is charged in a book written by former LAPD detective Greg Kading and released in October 2011 of reportedly paying Keefe D $1 million to assassinate Tupac Shakur and Suge Knight. Anderson’s car was parked adjacent to the BMW in which Tupac was fatally shot, according to Davis and Kading’s statements. Also, in a recorded conversation with Kading, he claimed that Anderson was the one who fired the shots that ultimately took Tupac’s life.</p><p>In July 2018, Keefe D came clean about his involvement in killing Tupac Shakur. He additionally asserted that he had been a passenger on the night of the event in the white Cadillac. He made the decision not to reveal the names of the other passengers in the car, though. Keefe D did, however, make it known that Orlando Anderson, his nephew, was the assailant. The lure of a $1 million prize given by Puff Daddy and a desire for vengeance following an altercation at the MGM Grand are thought to have been the driving forces behind this act of violence.</p><p>The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police detained Davis on September 29, 2023, in relation to the aforementioned homicide. Police searched Keefe D’s wife’s Nevada home earlier in July before his arrest in September. According to police reports, the goal of this raid was to find evidence related to Tupac Shakur’s murder.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2><strong>Keefe D Wife And Children&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Keefe D is married.
